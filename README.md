MultiClass-Prediction-of-Obesity-Risk. 
This repository contains a machine learning model that can be used to predict obesity risk in individuals, 
which is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.


The model is trained on a dataset of historical customer data,
and it uses a variety of machine learning algorithms to identify the factors that are most likely to lead to obesity risk.


How to use the model To use the model, follow these steps: Clone the repository to your local computer.


Install the required libraries.


 Open the notebook file in Colab. 


Run the notebook.

The model will be trained and saved to a file. You can then use the model to make predictions on new data. 

Evaluation The model was evaluated on a holdout dataset of customer data. The model achieved an accuracy of 95% in predicting obesity risk.
